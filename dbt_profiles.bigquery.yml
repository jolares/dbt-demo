## The connection profile manifest that dbt uses to connect to the data warehouse.
## This file is used by the CICD pipeline. The CI first substitutes values for the variables
## in this file, then stores the file at /Users/<service_username>/.dbt/profiles.yml
##
## Note: you can create multiple profiles within this file (e.g. one for dev and one for prod).
##
## See dbt docs on Connection profiles: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/connect-data-platform/connection-profiles
